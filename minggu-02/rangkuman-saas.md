## Difference between IaaS, SaaS, and Paas
### IaaS 
(Infrastructure as a Service) is a model by which computing resources are provided virtually. An IaaS cloud provider can give you the entire range of resources needed for an enterprise. It provides servers, storage and networking hard drive. It also provides maintenance and support. Businesses can fulfill there requirements without installing any hardware
. It provides resources on outsourced basis for enterprise operations. It also provides data center space and network components.
### SaaS 
(Software as a Service) is a model in which software is used and purchased by an online subscription rather than getting license, installing and using it as desktop software
. SaaS is centrally hosted. It is also called “on-demand-software” and “software plus services”. In this model a third party provider hosts the application and make this application available to subscribed users over the internet. This model gives a quick access to web applications. Maintenance and support is provided by the service provider. Following are some of the examples of SaaS
### PaaS 
(Platform as a Service) is a cloud computing model which provides a cloud base where you can test and run your applications. It simplifies the process of software development. Basically it is a model which provides hardware and software tools which are needed for application development process on the internet to the users. A Platform as a Service provider hosts hardware and software on its own infrastructure. Following are some of the examples of PaaS.

## SAAS Architecture
With this model, a single version of the application, with a single configuration is used for all customers. The application is installed on multiple machines to support scalability (called horizontal scaling). In some cases, a second version of the application is set up to offer a select group of customers with access to pre-release versions of the applications for testing purposes. In this traditional model, each version of the application is based on a unique code. Although an exception , some SaaS solutions do not use multitenancy, to cost-effectively manage a large number of customers in place.
