Business Process as a Service (BPaaS)
Cloud computing proved to offer flexible IT solutions. Although large enterprises
may benefit from this technology by educating their IT departments, SMEs are
dramatically falling behind in cloud usage and hence lose the ability to efficiently
adapt their IT to their business needs. This paper introduces the project idea of the
H2020 project CloudSocket, by elaborating the idea of Business Processes as a
Service (BPaaS), where concept models and semantics are applied to align
business processes with Cloud deployed workflows. The hybrid usage of
conceptual and semantic models introduce smart knowledge processing
mechanisms to bridge the semantic gap from business requests to deployable
workflow bundle. Ideas, Concept and technical issues are highlighted and first
prototypes introduced for download.
When one looks at the BPaaS in the Common Cloud Management Platform
Reference Architecture (Figure 1) proposed by IBM to the The Open Group, the
BPaaS sits above software as a service (SaaS) layer. BPaaS is about intelligently
consuming services from the SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS layer.
Discovery and documentation
The first step in any process improvement effort is getting a clear picture of where
you are today. With Blueworks Live, your whole team can engage collaboratively
in the process discovery exercise while your process experts can use complex
BPMN to document the most intricate aspects of your processes.
Private communities: Blueworks Live’s main login page immediately tells you
what changes have occurred to processes you are either directly or indirectly
involved in. Learn which new process have been “shared” or published, which
processes have been edited, and who has commented on which process. Choose to
“follow” work and processes that involve
Public communities: Use the built-in expert community to gain industry, process
improvement, and BPM knowledge. A curated Twitter stream is part of the
Community view to provide you with relevant blogs, white papers, and other
content that can help you improve your business operations.
Access control: Blueworks Live offers both Editor and Contributor licenses. As
an editor, you are able to create, modify, and share a Process Blueprint.
Contributors can view and comment on processes but aren’t able to modify or
create them. Both editors and contributors are able to configure and run Process
Apps with Blueworks Live. Blueworks Live allows the account administrator to
set the level of access, editor or contributor, for each individual process.
