Platform as a service (PaaS) or application platform as a service (aPaaS) or platform-based service
is a category of cloud computing services that provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run,
and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure
typically associated with developing and launching an app. or
Platform as a service (PaaS) is a complete development and deployment environment in the cloud, with
resources that enable you to deliver everything from simple cloud-based apps to sophisticated, cloudenabled
enterprise applications. You purchase the resources you need from a cloud service provider on
a pay-as-you-go basis and access them over a secure Internet connection.
Types
Public, private and hybrid
There are several types of PaaS, including public, private and hybrid. PaaS was originally intended for
applications on public cloud services, before expanding to include private and hybrid options.
Public PaaS is derived from software as a service (SaaS), and is situated in cloud computing between
SaaS and infrastructure as a service (IaaS). SaaS is software hosted in the cloud, so that it does not take
up hard drive space on the computers of users. IaaS provides virtual hardware from a provider with
adjustable scalability. With IaaS, the user still has to manage the server
Mobile platform as a service
Initiated in 2012, mobile PaaS (mPaaS) provides development capabilities for mobile app designers
and developers
Open PaaS
Open PaaS does not include hosting, but provides open source software allowing a PaaS provider to
run applications in an open source environment, such as Google App Engine
Common PaaS scenarios
Organizations typically use PaaS for these scenarios:
Development framework. PaaS provides a framework that developers can build upon to develop or
customize cloud-based applications. Similar to the way you create an Excel macro, PaaS lets
developers create applications using built-in software components. Cloud features such as scalability,
high-availability, and multi-tenant capability are included, reducing the amount of coding that
developers must do.
Analytics or business intelligence. Tools provided as a service with PaaS allow organizations to
analyze and mine their data, finding insights and patterns and predicting outcomes to improve
forecasting, product design decisions, investment returns, and other business decisions.
