Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) are online services that provide high-level APIs used to dereference
various low-level details of underlying network infrastructure like physical computing resources,
location, data partitioning, scaling, security, backup etc
Typically IaaS involves the use of a cloud orchestration technology like Open Stack, Apache
Cloudstack or OpenNebula. This manages the creation of a virtual machine and decides on which
hypervisor (i.e. physical host) to start it, enables VM migration features between hosts, allocates
storage volumes and attaches them to VMs, usage information for billing and lots more. IaaS,” is a
form of cloud computing that delivers fundamental compute, network, and storage resources to
consumers on-demand, over the internet, and on a pay-as-you-go basis.
IaaS emerged as a popular computing model in the early 2010s.
IaaS platform and architecture
IaaS is made up of a collection of physical and virtualized resources that provide consumers with the
basic building blocks needed to run applications and workloads in the cloud.
- Physical data centers:
IaaS providers will manage large data centers, typically around the world, that contain the physical
machines required to power the various layers of abstraction on top of them and that are made available
to end users over the web
Compute: IaaS is typically understood as virtualized compute resources, so for the purposes of this
article, we will define IaaS compute as a virtual machine.
Network: Networking in the cloud is a form of Software Defined Networking in which traditional
networking hardware, such as routers and switches, are made available programmatically, typically
through APIs.
Storage: The three primary types of cloud storage are block storage, file storage, and object storage.
- Block storage, sometimes referred to as block-level storage, is a technology that is used to
store data files on Storage Area Networks (SANs) or cloud-based storage environments
- File storage—also called file-level or file-based storage—is a hierarchical storage
methodology used to organize and store data on a computer hard drive or on networkattached
storage (NAS) device
- Object storage, often referred to as object-based storage, is a data storage architecture for
handling large amounts of unstructured data
Common IaaS business scenarios
Typical things businesses do with IaaS include:
Test and development. Teams can quickly set up and dismantle test and development environments,
bringing new applications to market faster.
Website hosting. Running websites using IaaS can be less expensive than traditional web hosting.
Storage, backup, and recovery. Organizations avoid the capital outlay for storage and complexity of
storage management, which typically requires a skilled staff to manage data and meet legal and
compliance requirements.
Web apps. IaaS provides all the infrastructure to support web apps, including storage, web and
application servers, and networking resources.
High-performance computing. High-performance computing (HPC) on supercomputers, computer
grids, or computer clusters helps solve complex problems involving millions of variables or
calculations.
Big data analysis. Big data is a popular term for massive data sets that contain potentially valuable
patterns, trends, and associations. Mining data sets to locate or tease out these hidden patterns requires
a huge amount of processing power, which IaaS economically provides.
Advantages of IaaS
Eliminates capital expense and reduces ongoing cost. IaaS sidesteps the upfront expense of setting
up and managing an onsite datacenter, making it an economical option for start-ups and businesses
testing new ideas.
Improves business continuity and disaster recovery. Achieving high availability, business continuity,
and disaster recovery is expensive, since it requires a significant amount of technology and staff.
Innovate rapidly. As soon as you’ve decided to launch a new product or initiative, the necessary
computing infrastructure can be ready in minutes or hours,
Respond quicker to shifting business conditions. IaaS enables you to quickly scale up resources to
accommodate spikes in demand for your application— during the holidays.
Focus on your core business. IaaS frees up your team to focus on your organization’s core business
rather than on IT infrastructure.
Increase stability, reliability, and supportability. With IaaS there’s no need to maintain and upgrade
